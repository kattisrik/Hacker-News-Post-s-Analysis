# Hacker-News-Post-s-Analysis

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit.

We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
